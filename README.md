# robot-assignment
first year robotics assignment, this was written in arduino which is technically C, however some C++ was used in the project
where arduino allows it.
Wasn't my best piece of work in the end with some bugs but the structure is quite clean and in theory the project should 
have worked very well but ended up not giving the best end results.
